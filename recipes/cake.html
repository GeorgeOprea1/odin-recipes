      <h1 c>Versunkener Apfelkuchen (German Sunken Apple Cake)</h1>
      <img src="cake.jpg" />

      <h2>Description</h2>
      <p>
        For this apple cake you need to cut the apples like a fan not only for
        looks — this little trick makes the cake especially moist. I like to use
        tart apples. You will need between 5 and 7 apples, depending on their
        size.
      </p>

      <h2>Ingredients</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>9 tablespoons unsalted butter, at room temperature</li>
        <li>10 tablespoons white sugar</li>
        <li>3 large eggs, at room temperature</li>
        <li>1 ½ cups all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons baking powder</li>
        <li>3 medium apples, or as needed</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon confectioners' sugar for dusting, or as needed</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Steps</h2>
      <ol>
        <li><strong>Step 1</strong></li>
        <p>
          Beat butter in a large bowl with an electric mixer until creamy.
          Gradually add sugar and mix until well combined. Add eggs, 1 at a
          time, mixing well after each addition.
        </p>
        <li><strong>Step 2</strong></li>
        <p>
          Mix 1 1/2 cups plus 2 tablespoon flour and baking powder in a separate
          bowl. Add to batter and mix until batter is smooth.
        </p>
        <li><strong>Step 3</strong></li>
        <p>
          Peel and quarter apples. Remove core and cut apples like a fan from
          the outside towards the inside but do not cut all the way through.
        </p>
        <li><strong>Step 4</strong></li>
        <p>
          Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a springform
          pan with butter.
        </p>
        <li><strong>Step 5</strong></li>
        <p>
          Spoon batter into the prepared springform pan and spread out evenly.
          Set cut apple quarters in a circle into the batter with the round, cut
          side facing up. Gently push apples into the batter.
        </p>
        <li><strong>Step 6</strong></li>
        <p>
          Bake in the preheated oven until cake is golden brown, about 45
          minutes.
        </p>
        <li><strong>Step 7</strong></li>
        <p>
          Remove from oven, allow to cool, and dust cooled cake with
          confectioners' sugar.
        </p>
